I don't understand the concept of Resume, reading about stuff I've done should not replace a first interview in which we talk.
So here's kind of a resume, with comments, side notes and memories.
You won't find a PDF resume here, too hard to keep up to date, and I'm no UI designer 🙊

## Skills


## Experiences
### Mention Solutions - 2015->Today
- Since day one at Mention I have been a one man team 💪
- I started there by an audit of there iOS app, it leaded to a complete refactoring, migrating from objective-C to Swift, reducing dependencies and reworking UX and UI with the help of the designer
- Next step was to extract the business logic into an SDK. This served two purposes, architecturing the app into separated separated "front" and business parts, and preparing for future applications depending on the same APIs
- API is a mix of REST and GraphQL, of course I much prefer GraphQL over Rest 😼 Btw, the GraphQL implementation was completely custom made to avoid those huge generated files that Apollo outputs 🤢
- Realtimeness with WebSockets, customers love this
- Lots of RnD, for potential side apps, custom charts, animations, UX experiments, SwiftUI 🤩, data persistence, React Native and much more (can't tell everything right ? 😋)
- Overseeing the development of the Android app too, I wish I had more time to dig into that part, Kotlin is fun too
- Recruiting the new Android dev in 2019, and so creating Android and Kotlin challenges for the candidates
- And mentoring and managing the wonderfull Android developer that joined us last year
- Working with our VPE to adapt and make good use of Medium's Engineering Growth Framework (btw, hmu if you want to talk about that)
- Member of the companie's CSE, and working through that CoVid19 crisis was no walk in the park 😿
- And now, well, now I work on the WebApp as a ReactJS developer, it's fun but not as fun as making good Mobile Applications
 
### RotorMatch 2016->2017
- Co-Founder, and all the non tech thing that came with it
- Drone racing event organisation
- Race timing system developement
  - Emebed system for captation
  - Swift app for data reading and backend synchronisation (custom UDP library inside)
  - Web app for race control center
  - Live streaming to multiple platform, including our own RotorTV
  - Multiple onsite projection plateforms for Public and Participants (I can't count how many Raspberries we had then 😹)
 - Event planing plateform
 - Ticket booking plateform
 - Hardware
 - Reverse engineering diverse custom protocols to improve our services (thanks Epitech for telling me about Endianness 😅)

## Education
### Epitech
- Five intenses years of studies in Lille, Paris and abroad
- Touched about anything from ASM to C#, from Heavy traffic back-end to video games, from HelloWorlds in too many languages to trading bots (that lost us too much money, don't try this at home kids)
- We landed a cool  shout them all for Windows and XBox for our 3rd year project
- Learned the (very) hard way to code alongside a strict norm
- Managing small teams since year 1
- Learning that team diversity won't be achieve easily, and that it is the best way to have a team that grows stronger

### 北京交通大学 (Beijing Jiaotong University)
- Mostly working on our final project, when we were not exploring the country ;)
- Learn the bases of Mandarin, but I still can't write nor read chinese
- Watch the wonderfull WWDC Keynote of 2014 and start working on my first Swift app 10 minutes after that (yes, at 3am Beijing time 🤓)
- Develope a GPS driver for an embeded app project, and learn that Chinese GPS is shifting coordinates, thats crazy 😵
